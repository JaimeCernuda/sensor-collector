<objective>
Write the ChronoTick technical approach, results summary, and contributions list (Paragraphs 5-7) of the introduction.

Purpose: The reader will understand exactly what ChronoTick does technically, what results it achieves, and what the enumerated contributions are. Paragraph 5 is THE paragraph that must land -- the core technical description.

Output: ~380 words of LaTeX covering three elements: the technical approach paragraph, a brief results paragraph, and a standard contributions enumeration.

Prerequisite: Plans 01 and 02 must be completed first. Read both summaries for continuity.

    Write Paragraphs 5 and 6: ChronoTick's technical approach (THE paragraph that must land) and a brief results summary.

    IMPORTANT: Append these paragraphs to the existing content in sections/1.a.introduction.tex (which contains Paragraphs 1-4 from Plans 01-02). Do NOT overwrite. Add a blank line after Paragraph 4, then write.

    **Paragraph 5 (~150 words) -- Technical approach (MUST LAND):**
    This is the most important paragraph in the introduction. It must clearly convey what ChronoTick IS and HOW it works.

    Key points in this order:
    1. Opening: "We present ChronoTick, a system that applies zero-shot time series foundation models to multivariate oscillator drift prediction on commodity hardware." (or similar -- this sentence defines the system.)
    2. Dual-model architecture: ChronoTick runs Chronos and TimesFM in parallel, fusing predictions via inverse variance weighting. The dual-model approach provides robustness -- each model captures different temporal patterns.
    3. Retrospective correction: A retrospective correction mechanism uses future sensor readings to refine past predictions, enabling continuous adaptation to crystal aging and environmental changes.
    4. Multivariate input: The system ingests multiple Linux hwmon sensor streams -- thermal zones, CPU frequency, system load -- capturing environmental dynamics that a single temperature sensor misses.
    5. Zero calibration: No per-device training, no specialized hardware. A pre-trained foundation model predicts drift on unseen hardware immediately.
    6. Integration: ChronoTick integrates directly with chrony for real-time NTP clock correction.

    Tone: Confident, precise, technical but accessible. Each sentence should add information. This paragraph should feel dense with substance, not padded.

    **Paragraph 6 (~80 words) -- Results summary:**
    Brief results and open-source statement.

    Key points:
    1. 0.604 ms MAE across heterogeneous platforms without per-device training.
    2. 2.5-3x better temporal consistency than commodity NTP.
    3. Mention uncertainty: the foundation models provide native prediction intervals (94.9% coverage), briefly. Do NOT make this a primary focus -- one clause is enough.
    4. Open-source: ChronoTick is released as open-source software, providing the first publicly available ML-based clock compensation system.

    Tone: Concise, results-forward. Do not oversell. State numbers and move on.

    Output format: Raw LaTeX appended to the existing file. Use \cite{} for any citations needed. Use LaTeX math mode for numbers.

  <name>Task 2: Contributions enumeration</name>
  <target>~150 words</target>
  <action>
    Write Paragraph 7: the contributions enumeration. This is a standard LaTeX \begin{enumerate} list of 4-5 contributions.

    IMPORTANT: Append after Paragraph 6 in sections/1.a.introduction.tex. Add a blank line, then write.

    Structure:
    - One-sentence lead-in: "This paper makes the following contributions:" (or similar standard phrasing).
    - \begin{enumerate} with 4-5 items, each with a \textbf{bold label} followed by a colon and one-sentence description.

    Contributions to enumerate (in this order):
    1. **Foundation models for oscillator compensation**: First application of zero-shot time series foundation models to commodity oscillator drift prediction, eliminating per-device calibration.
    2. **Dual-model fusion architecture**: Inverse variance weighted fusion of Chronos and TimesFM predictions for robust drift correction.
    3. **Multivariate sensor exploitation**: Systematic use of multiple Linux hwmon sensor streams (thermal zones, CPU frequency, system load) for clock compensation, extending beyond single-sensor approaches.
    4. **Online adaptive correction**: Retrospective correction mechanism that continuously refines prediction data, enabling adaptation to crystal aging and environmental drift without manual recalibration.
    5. **Open-source system**: First publicly available ML-based clock compensation system, integrating data collection, model inference, and real-time chrony correction in a complete pipeline.

    Important framing notes:
    - Do NOT list uncertainty as a standalone primary contribution. It can appear as a parenthetical within another contribution (e.g., "with native prediction intervals" as part of the foundation model contribution) but should not be its own bullet.
    - Do NOT mention PTP or TrueTime.
    - Keep each item to 1-2 sentences maximum.
    - The list should feel like a standard IEEE conference contributions list -- concise, clear, parallel structure.

    Output format: Raw LaTeX. Lead-in sentence, then \begin{enumerate}...\end{enumerate}. Each item uses \item \textbf{Label}: Description.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Word count: 120-180 words (including lead-in)
    - 4-5 enumerated contributions
    - Each contribution has \textbf{bold label}: description format
    - Uncertainty is NOT a standalone contribution (at most a parenthetical)
