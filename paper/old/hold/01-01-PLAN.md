<objective>
Write the opening two paragraphs of the ChronoTick introduction: the oscillator drift problem and the compensation landscape including Graham as a landmark.

Purpose: The reader will understand (1) that commodity oscillator drift is a real, quantifiable problem limiting holdover, and (2) that software-defined compensation is viable and impactful, with Graham as the pioneering demonstration.

Output: ~300 words of LaTeX covering two flowing narrative paragraphs (Paragraphs 1-2 of the introduction).

  <name>Task 1: The oscillator drift problem</name>
  <target>~150 words</target>
  <action>
    Write the opening paragraph of \section{Introduction} establishing the oscillator drift problem. This paragraph grounds the paper in physics and motivates software-defined compensation.

    Key points to cover, in this order:
    1. Commodity servers use cheap uncompensated quartz oscillators (XOs) whose frequency varies with temperature.
    2. Quantify: +/-20-50 ppm drift; a 10C temperature swing from CPU load produces ~10 us/s of uncorrected drift.
    3. Over minutes of holdover between NTP corrections, this accumulates to tens or hundreds of microseconds of clock error.
    4. NTP corrects drift periodically, but between corrections the clock free-runs on the local oscillator.
    5. TCXOs reduce sensitivity by 10-100x through analog compensation, but cost $5-50 per unit and require board-level integration unavailable in commodity servers.
    6. End with a transition: software-defined compensation offers an alternative path -- using ML to predict and correct drift using sensors already present on the motherboard.

    Cite: \cite{ntp} for NTP, \cite{tirado_andres_clock_sources_2019} for multi-factor drift dependence.

    Tone: Confident, direct, technically grounded. Full flowing paragraph, not bullet fragments. Write as a narrative that builds from the physical reality to the opportunity. Do NOT include a standalone italicized research question -- weave motivation into the narrative naturally.

    Output format: Raw LaTeX. Begin with \section{Introduction} on its own line, then a blank line, then the paragraph text. Use \cite{} for citations. Use LaTeX math mode for units and quantities (e.g., $\pm$20--50\,ppm, ${\sim}$10\,$\mu$s/s).

  <name>Task 2: The compensation landscape and Graham as landmark</name>
  <target>~150 words</target>
  <action>
    Write the second paragraph: the compensation landscape with Graham as the landmark result.

    Key points to cover, in this order:
    1. Software temperature compensation has a long history. Chrony's tempcomp directive provides quadratic polynomial compensation from a single hwmon sensor, achieving a 3.54x improvement (offset standard deviation from 6.3 us to 1.78 us).
    2. Graham (NSDI'22) was a landmark advance: it demonstrated that reading commodity DIMM temperature sensors and fitting cubic polynomials to the temperature-frequency relationship reduces drift by 2000x (200 ppm to 100 ppb), effectively building a software-defined TCXO.
    3. Graham's key insight: the DIMM sensor serves as a better crystal proxy than the CPU die temperature due to lower thermal lag, and each crystal has a unique frequency-temperature curve from manufacturing variance.
    4. End with a transition sentence that acknowledges Graham opened the field and suggests the broader community has since been advancing along several dimensions. This sets up Paragraph 3 (community trends, which will be in Plan 02).

    Cite: \cite{ntp_performance_chrony_ntpd} for chrony tempcomp, \cite{graham_nsdi22} for Graham.

    Tone: Generous and respectful toward Graham. Use "landmark" or "pioneering" language. Frame Graham as opening the door, not as a system to attack. This is the "be generous to Graham" paragraph.

    Output format: Raw LaTeX. Blank line before paragraph. Use \cite{} for citations. Proper LaTeX math mode for numbers.

    2. Is the Graham paragraph generous enough? Does "landmark" framing feel right?
    3. Does the transition from P2 to P3 (community trends) feel natural?
