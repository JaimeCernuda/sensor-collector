<objective>
Write the community trends and foundation models paragraphs (Paragraphs 3-4) of the ChronoTick introduction.

Purpose: The reader will understand that the broader clock compensation community has been advancing along several axes (polynomial->ML, single->multivariate, long->zero calibration), and that foundation time series models offer a new capability at this intersection.

Output: ~320 words of LaTeX covering two flowing narrative paragraphs. These are the citation-heavy paragraphs that do the heavy lifting of establishing the research landscape without targeting Graham.

Prerequisite: Plan 01 must be completed first. Read .planning/sections/01-introduction/01-01-SUMMARY.md for continuity.

    Write Paragraph 3: the community trends paragraph. This is the citation-heavy paragraph that establishes the research landscape and does the heavy lifting of motivating ChronoTick's design choices.

    IMPORTANT: Append this paragraph to the existing content in sections/1.a.introduction.tex (which contains Paragraphs 1-2 from Plan 01). Do NOT overwrite the existing content. Add a blank line after the last paragraph, then write this paragraph.

    Key points to weave into a flowing narrative (not as a bullet list):
    1. The broader oscillator/clock compensation community has been advancing along several dimensions simultaneously.
    2. Trend: Static polynomials -> adaptive ML. LSTM networks improve satellite clock prediction by 72% over ARIMA (He 2023). Attention mechanisms add further gains (Wang 2024). A 2025 review documents the consistent superiority of neural approaches for nonlinear scenarios.
    3. Trend: Single-sensor -> multivariate. Multivariate CNN-LSTM models exploit inter-signal correlations, achieving 84% improvement over univariate baselines for clock prediction (Li 2024). Environment-aware compensation leveraging multiple factors has been explored in wireless networks for over a decade (Yang 2012).
    4. Trend: Long per-device calibration -> reduced calibration. Transfer learning reduces calibration requirements for oscillator prediction (Su 2024), pointing toward zero-calibration as the end of this trajectory.
    5. End with a sentence noting that these advances remain domain-siloed: the satellite clock community, WSN community, and datacenter systems community have pursued these improvements largely independently.

    Tone: Scholarly, building momentum. This paragraph should feel like surveying a field in motion, not criticizing any single work. The trends should feel inevitable and well-evidenced. Dense with citations but still readable as narrative prose.

    Style: Full flowing paragraph. Do NOT use bullet points, enumerated lists, or sub-paragraphs. Weave the three trends together into a coherent narrative with smooth transitions between them. The word "trend" itself should NOT appear repeatedly -- vary the language (e.g., "advancing along several dimensions," "a parallel shift," "at the same time").

    Output format: Raw LaTeX appended to the existing file content. Use \cite{} for all citations. Proper LaTeX math mode for percentages and numbers.

    Write Paragraph 4: foundation models as a new capability for oscillator compensation.

    IMPORTANT: Append this paragraph after Paragraph 3 in sections/1.a.introduction.tex. Add a blank line, then write the paragraph.

    Key points to cover:
    1. Time series foundation models (2023-2025) -- pre-trained on diverse time series data, capable of zero-shot generalization -- offer a new capability at this intersection.
    2. Name specific models: Chronos and TimesFM demonstrate that patterns learned from diverse time series transfer to unseen domains with zero-shot inference.
    3. Datadog's Toto demonstrates that foundation models work on infrastructure-domain metrics, establishing precedent for applying these models to systems-level signals.
    4. These capabilities align naturally with the compensation community's trajectory: zero-shot addresses the calibration gap, multivariate input support addresses the sensor gap, and probabilistic outputs provide native uncertainty quantification.
    5. End with transition: no prior work has brought these capabilities to bear on oscillator drift prediction.

    Citations to include:
    - \cite{Chronos} — Chronos
    - \cite{TimesFM} — TimesFM

    Tone: Forward-looking, connecting the dots. This paragraph bridges from "the field is moving" to "here is the new tool that enables the next step." Not hyperbolic -- factual about what foundation models offer.

    1. Does Paragraph 3 read as a flowing survey of a field in motion, not a bullet list?
    2. Are the three trends (polynomial->ML, single->multivariate, long->zero calibration) clear?
    3. Is citation density appropriate -- grounded but not overwhelming?
    4. Does Paragraph 4 connect foundation models to the trends naturally?
    5. Is the gap statement at the end of P4 positioned correctly (emerging from narrative)?
    6. Does this pair of paragraphs flow from Plan 01's P2 ending?
